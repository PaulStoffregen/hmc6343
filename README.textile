h2. Summary

Wrote a quick library to interface with the HMC6343 tilt compensated compass unit with an arduino,
even though this is not a complicated unit to interface with this simplifies the job further.

h2. Getting Started

Hook it up to the i2c pins on your arduino (A4 and A5 or the dedicated pins on newer versions)

If you are using a 5v arduino as most people you should also throw in a 5v - 3v logic level converter to make sure you don't get 150USD worth of blue smoke, unless that's your thing of course.

h2. Software

You need some way of compiling and uploading it to your arduino (DUH!)

h2. Todo list:

	- Make a function for calibration
	- Make a function to set the orientation of the device (by default it should be placed flat)
	- Make schematics to show how to wire the HMC6343 to the arduino

h2. Found some bugs issues or some improvement?

Please do not hesitate to send me an email with the problem and what sort of arduino you are using and what you did to create the bug/problem.

And of course if you have some solution to something your solution will be marked with comments within the appropiate section of code :)
