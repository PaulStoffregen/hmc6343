h2. Summary

Wrote a quick library to interface with the HMC6343 tilt compensated compass unit with an arduino,
not that its anything even remotely close to complicated, this just simplifies the job.

h2. Getting Started

Hook it up to the i2c pins on your arduino (A4 and A5 or the dedicated pins on newer versions)

If you are using a 5v arduino as most people you should also throw in a 5v - 3v logic level converter to make sure you don't get 150USD worth of blue smoke, unless that's your thing of course.

h2. Software

You need some way of compiling and uploading it to your arduino (DUH!)

For the coding examples I have used the streaming library to output things to the serial line
just because it makes it a lot easier than the horrendously tedious print statements you are forced to use by default.

you can find the streaming library here: http://arduiniana.org/libraries/streaming/

if you can't figure out how to print the data without this library you've pretty much wasted 150USD on some really advanced kit you'll never get use for.
